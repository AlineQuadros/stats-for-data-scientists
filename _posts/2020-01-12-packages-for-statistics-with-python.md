Scipy and Statsmodels are your tools for statistics in Python. Sklearn also has a lot of stuff

*Scipy* is more user-friendly

>Statsmodels is easier if you come from R and are used to its formula-like modelling (I like their summary reports)

>You’ll need Statsmodels for general and generalized linear models

### Little dictionary to help get started with these packages 

SCIPY’s Methods of Random variables (RVs):

rvs: Random `Variates`
pdf: Probability Density Function
cdf: Cumulative Distribution Function
sf: Survival Function (1-CDF)
ppf: Percent Point Function (Inverse of CDF)
isf: Inverse Survival Function (Inverse of SF)
stats: Return mean, variance, (Fisher’s) skew, or (Fisher’s) kurtosis
moment: non-central moments of the distribution

Statsmodels:

Exogenous variables = x;  predictor, independent
Endogenous variables = y; response; dependant;
